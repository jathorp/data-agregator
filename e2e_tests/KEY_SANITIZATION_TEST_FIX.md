# Key Sanitization Test Fix

## Problem Description

Test 11 (key sanitization test) was failing because the test logic incorrectly expected both the safe file AND the malicious file to appear in the output bundle after "sanitization". However, the Lambda function was working correctly by **rejecting** the malicious file entirely during validation.

## Root Cause

The AWS logs showed that:
1. The malicious file `data/e2e-test-xxx/../../malicious_file.txt` was correctly **rejected** with validation error: "S3 key contains path traversal sequence ('..')."
2. Only the safe file `data/e2e-test-xxx/safe_file.txt` was processed and bundled.

But the test runner's `_run_key_sanitization_test()` method was creating a manifest expecting to find **both files** in the output bundle, which was incorrect.

## The Fix

### 1. Updated Test Logic
Modified `_run_key_sanitization_test()` to:
- Only expect the **safe file** in the final validation manifest
- **Not expect the malicious file** since it should be rejected by validation
- The test now **passes** when only the safe file is found and the malicious file is absent

### 2. Updated Documentation
Updated the method's docstring to clearly explain:
- The test uploads one valid file and one with a path traversal attempt
- The Lambda should reject the malicious file during validation
- **Expected outcome**: Only the safe file appears in the output bundle, the malicious file is rejected with a validation error and never processed

### 3. Improved Success Messages
Updated the success/failure messages to accurately reflect what the test is validating:
- Success: "The malicious file was correctly rejected and only the safe file was processed"
- Failure: "Validation failed. The security control did not work as expected"

## Key Changes Made

```python
# OLD: Incorrectly expected both files in manifest
hashes_by_expected_key = {}
# ... stored both safe and malicious file info

# NEW: Only expect the safe file
safe_file_info = None
# ... only store safe file info
self.manifest = {
    "source_files": [safe_file_info],  # Only safe file
}
```

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
1. **Test Isolation**: The test correctly validates the security control
2. **Accurate Results**: The test passes when the Lambda correctly rejects malicious files
3. **Clear Intent**: The test documentation clearly explains the expected behavior

The key sanitization test now properly validates that the Lambda's security controls work as intended by rejecting malicious path traversal attempts.
