Orchestrates Terraform commands across all components for an entire environment.

Usage: ./env.sh <environment> <command> [terraform_options]

Arguments:
  <environment>   The target environment (e.g., "dev", "prod").
  <command>       The Terraform command to run on all components (e.g., "plan", "apply", "destroy").

Examples:
  # Plan changes for the entire 'dev' environment
  ./env.sh dev plan

  # Apply changes to the 'prod' environment (will prompt for each component)
  ./env.sh prod apply

  # Pass options through to Terraform for CI/CD (use with extreme caution)
  ./env.sh dev apply -auto-approve

  # Destroy the 'dev' environment (will prompt for each component)
  ./env.sh dev destroy
